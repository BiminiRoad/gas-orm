# CodeIgniter Gas ORM Library

A lighweight and easy-to-use ORM for CodeIgniter

## Installation
Put Gas.php on your libraries folder and gas.php in config folder. 

## Configuration
Gas just have three option for configuration

```php
/* here you can specify your models directory. This is relative to application folder. */
$config['models_path'] = 'models';

/* by default the prefix is _gas, so typically your model file name would be something like foo_gas.php. */
$config['models_suffix'] = '_gas';

/* if this set to TRUE, then all models class will automaticly loaded. If this set to FALSE, you need to manually load each model you want to use, using $this->gas->load('foo', 'bar', 'and_so_on'). */
$config['autoload_models'] = TRUE;
```

## Convention
Gas makes some assumptions about your database structure. Each table should have primary key, default to **id**. You can set this dynamically in your Gas model. Each table should have same name with its corresponding Gas model's name.

Typically your Gas model will be something like this, let say you have **user_gas.php** to hold **user** table.

```php
class User extends Gas {

}
```

if you need to go more depth with your model configuration, below is the common template of your Gas model :

```php
class User extends Gas {
    
    // if your table name different with your model class's name, you can set it to $table properties, eg :
    //
    // public $table = 'people';

    // if your primary key isn't id, you can set it to $primary_key properties, eg :
    //
    // public $primary_key = 'primary_id';

    // If your table has relationship, you can assign an array that contain its corresponding model
    // Gas support 'has_one', 'has_many', 'belongs_to' and 'has_and_belongs_to', eg :
    //
    // public $relations = array(
                            'has_one' => array('wife' => array()),
                            'has_many' => array('kid' => array()),
                            'has_and_belongs_to' => array('job' => array()),
                        );

    // Every Gas model could have _init function. It primarily used for set up a table's fields validation
    // but it can be used for construct/set any model properties or loading common resources.
    //
    // Available field to use is 'auto', 'char', 'int' and 'email'. You can add max length rule directly using [n].
    // But you can assign additional validation rule as array, including your own callback to second parameter, eg :
    //
    // 'somefield' => Gas::field('char[255]', array('required', 'matches', 'callback_some_check')),
    //
    // function _init()
    // {
    //    $this->_fields = array(
    //      'id'       => Gas::field('auto'),
    //      'name'     => Gas::field('char[40]'),
    //      'email'    => Gas::field('email'),
    //      'username' => Gas::field('char'),
    //      'active'   => Gas::field('int[1]'),
    //    );
    // }

    // Suppose you set some custom callback function on your field validation rule, now you will need to
    // specify it in your model. Your callback function will slightly different with normal CI callback function, 
    // it need to have two parameter : first for accept field and second for accept value. If you want to
    // set up a custom error message, you will need to add $field (the first parameter variable) as third parameter,
    // eg :

    // public function some_check($field, $val)
    // {
    //    if($val == 'must_like_these')
    //    {
    //        return TRUE;
    //    }
    //    else
    //    {
    //        $this->set_message('some_check', 'The %s field should only contain \'must_like_these\'', $field);
    //  
    //        return FALSE;
    //    }
    // }
    
}
```

Gas support for cascading directories, so you can have as many sub-level folder as you want, in your primary models directory.

## Usage
The simplest way to start using Gas as your ORM, is to autoload Gas library in your application/config/autoload.php. 

```php
$autoload['libraries'] = array('gas');
```

If you decide to manually loading it, you will need to load/include your model first. Typically, you would do that as follow (eg, in some controller's function) :

```php
$this->load->library('gas');
// to see available models :
// var_dump($this->gas->list_models());

// now, if you want to load the user model
$this->gas->load('user');
```

now you are ready to go

### Fetch records
You can do almost anything you want : find by primary key, find where arguments, join, aggregates and so on. Heres some basic :

```php
$user = new User;

// all
$users = $user->all(); // will return a set/array of user object
if($user->has_result())
{
    // get total users
    echo 'There are total : .'$user->count();
    
    foreach($users as $single_user)
    {
        // to produce an array of single user
        var_dump($single_user->to_array());

        // or just fetch the corresponding table properties
        echo $single_user->id . '<br />';
        echo $single_user->email . '<br />';
        echo '<hr />';
    }
}

// first
$firstuser = $user->first(); // will return a single user object

// last
$lastuser = $user->last(); // will return a single user object

// aggregate : max, min, avg, sum
$max = $user->max(); // will return a single user object, with max id
$min = $user->min('money'); // will return a single user object, with min money
$avg = $user->avg();
$sum = $user->sum();

// finder : find, find_by_something, find_where
$someusers = $user->find(1, 2, 3); // will return a set/array of user
$someuser = $user->find(1); // will return a single user object with id = 1

$someusers = $user->find_by_email('foo@bar.com'); // will return a set/array of user object
$someuser = $user->find_by_email('foo@bar.com', 1); // will return a single match of user object

$someusers = $user->find_where(aray('active' => 1)); // will return a set/array of user object
$someuser = $user->find_where(aray('active' => 1), 1); // will return a single match of user object

// all standard CI AR clause statement : where, group_by, join, like and so on.
$join_user = $user->left_join_phone()->find(35); // will produces : SELECT * FROM (`user`) LEFT JOIN `phone` ON `phone`.`id` = `dummy`.`id` WHERE `dummy`.`id` =  35
$grouped_users = $user->group_by('email')->all(); // will return a set/array of user object
$liked_users = $user->like('username', $some_key)->all(); // will return a set/array of user object
```

### Write Operations (Insert, Update, Delete)
Since Gas utilize CI Form Validation, data validation process will not longer need draw a dragon in your code-blocks. Since validation is an optional feature, soon you set up your _fields at _init method, your fields will be validated if you try to save a record(s) and passed TRUE parameter into save method. Update and delete process will be follow your recorded logic.

```php
$user = new User;

// SAVE
/* Suppose your form return POST value as follow
$_POST = array(
    'id' => null,
    'name' => 'Mr. Foo',
    'email' => 'foo@bar.com',
    'username' => 'foobar',
);
*/

$user->id = $_POST['id'];
$user->name = $_POST['name'];
$user->email = $_POST['email'];
$user->username = $_POST['username'];

// If you passing TRUE as save() parameter, Gas will do validation rule
// which you set in your fields type in _init method
if( ! $user->save(TRUE))
{
    // If theres error(s), you can retrieve it using errors() method
    var_dump($user->errors());
}
else 
{
    $created_id = $user->last_id();
}

// UPDATE
$user_update = $user->find($created_id);

if($user->has_result())
{
    $user_update->email = 'changed@world.com';
    $user->save();
    var_dump($user_update->errors());
}

// DELETE
$user_delete = $user->find($created_id);

if($user->has_result())
{
    var_dump($user_delete->delete());
}
// If you want to delete exact id, you can do this too
// $user->delete(1);
// or
// $user->delete(2, 3, 4);
```

### Relationship
Gas supported three type of table relationship, **one-to-one** relationship, **one-to-many** relationship and **many-to-many** relationship. All you have to do, is to define your table relations at $relations properties in your model.

#### One to One Relationship
First, we will talk about **has_one** relationship. For example, let say we have two table which have one-to-one relationship, user table and wife table, then each table should have $relations properties as follow :

Your **user** model would be something like :

```php
class User extends Gas {
    
    public $relations = array(
                            'has_one' => array('wife' => array()),
                        );

    // Optionally, you can also define your model/table relation within _init method
    // function _init()
    // {
    //    $this->_has_one = array(
    //      'wife' => array()
    //    );
    // }
}
```

Then, your **wife** model would be something like :

```php
class Wife extends Gas {
    
    public $relations = array(
                            'belongs_to' => array('user' => array()),
                        );

    // Optionally, you can also define your model/table relation within _init method
    // function _init()
    // {
    //    $this->_belongs_to = array(
    //      'user' => array()
    //    );
    // }
}
```
This assumes that your **wife** table has **user_id** field, as FK to refer **user** table, make sense right? Since you have define your tables/models relation, your can intuitively retrieve its relation like below :

```php
$user = new User;

// retrieve user's wife
$user1 = $user->find(1);

if($user->has_result())
{
    echo 'User\'s email is : '.$user1->email;
    echo 'User with id '.$user1->id.' has one wife, with these details : ';
    var_dump($user1->wife->to_array());

    // You can now, for example, delete the wife from user object
    var_dump($user1->wife->delete()); // will delete the wife record with user_id = 1
}

// otherwise, you can also retrieve belongs_to
$wife = new Wife;

// retrieve wife
$wife1 = $wife->find(1);

if($wife->has_result())
{
    echo 'Wife\'s name is : '.$wife1->name;
    echo 'Her husband is '.$wife1->user->id.', with these details : ';
    var_dump($wife1->user->to_array());

    // You can now, update the related user from wife object
    $wife1->user->active = 0;
    var_dump($wife1->user->save());
}
```

#### One to Many Relationship
Secondly, we will talk about **has_many** relationship. This relationship type, is similar with above, except for **one-to-many** relationship, Gas will asume that one record from parent table, is **always** have several records in child table. For example, lets say we have two table which have one-to-many relationship, user table (as parent table) and kid table (as child table), then each table should have $relations properties as follow :

Your **user** model would be something like :

```php
class User extends Gas {
    
    public $relations = array(
                            'has_one' => array('wife' => array()),
                            'has_many' => array('kid' => array())
                        );

    // Optionally, you can also define your model/table relation within _init method
    // function _init()
    // {
    //    $this->_has_one = array(
    //      'wife' => array()
    //    );
    //
    //    $this->_has_many = array(
    //      'kid' => array()
    //    );
    // }
}
```

Then, your **kid** model would be something like :

```php
class Kid extends Gas {
    
    public $relations = array(
                            'belongs_to' => array('user' => array()),
                        );

    // Optionally, you can also define your model/table relation within _init method
    // function _init()
    // {
    //    $this->_belongs_to = array(
    //      'user' => array()
    //    );
    // }
}
```

You can do each action as **one-to-one** example above, except since this is **one-to-many** relationship : your child object will be a set/array of object instead one single object.

```php
$user = new User;

// retrieve user's kid
$user1 = $user->find(1);

if($user->has_result())
{
    echo 'User\'s email is : '.$user1->email;
    echo 'User with id '.$user1->id.' has '.count($user1->kid).' kids, with these details : ';
    foreach($user1->kid as $kid)
    {
        var_dump($kid->to_array());

         // You can now, for example, delete some kid data
         if($kid->name == 'bad boy')
         {
            var_dump($kid->delete()); // will delete the kid record with user_id = 1 and name = 'bad boy'
         }
    }

   
}

// otherwise, you can also retrieve belongs_to, like one-to-one example above
$kid = new Kid;

// retrieve kid
$kid1 = $kid->find(1);

if($kid->has_result())
{
    echo 'Kid\'s name is : '.$kid1->name;
    echo 'His/her parent is '.$kid1->user->id.', with these details : ';
    var_dump($kid1->user->to_array());

    // You can now, update the related user from kid object
    $kid1->user->email = 'parentofkid'.$kid1->id.'@goodparent.com';
    var_dump($kid1->user->save());
}
```

#### Many to Many Relationship
Last, this is the most tricky relationship in your database. This relationship type, is exist when you have a pivot table. Pivot table is an intermediate table, which links one table with another table, when each table is having many and belongs to each other. 

For example, assume a **user** has many **job**, but a **job** can also belong to many **user**. Three tables must be created to accomplish this relationship: a **user** table, a **job** table, and a **job_user** table. When using Gas, you aren't need to create **job_user** model, instead, what you have to do is define **has_and_belongs_to** properties in your corresponding table(s). So refer to above scenario (user and job), you will take this below step.

Your **user** model would be something like :

```php
class User extends Gas {
    
    public $relations = array(
                            'has_one' => array('wife' => array()),
                            'has_many' => array('kid' => array()),
                            'has_and_belong_to' => array('job' => array()),
                        );

    // Optionally, you can also define your model/table relation within _init method
    // function _init()
    // {
    //    $this->_has_one = array(
    //      'wife' => array()
    //    );
    //
    //    $this->_has_many = array(
    //      'kid' => array()
    //    );
    //
    //    $this->_has_and_belongs_to = array(
    //      'job' => array()
    //    );
    // }
}
```

Then, your **job** model would be something like :

```php
class Job extends Gas {
    
    public $relations = array(
                            'has_and_belongs_to' => array('user' => array()),
                        );

    // Optionally, you can also define your model/table relation within _init method
    // function _init()
    // {
    //    $this->_has_and_belongs_to = array(
    //      'user' => array()
    //    );
    // }
}
```

Now, let say you have those tables entries, as follow
##### **user** table
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>id</th>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>email</th>
    <th>username</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Foo</td>
    <td>foo@world.com</td>
    <td>foo</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Bar</td>
    <td>bar@world.com</td>
    <td>bar</td>
  </tr>
</table>
##### **job** table
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>id</th>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Developer</td>
    <td>Awesome job, but sometimes makes you bored.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Politician</td>
    <td>This is not really a job.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Accountant</td>
    <td>Boring job, but you will get free snack at lunch.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### **job_user** table
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>user_id</th>
    <th>job_id</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

With each model defined **has_and_belongs_to** property, now you can do :

```php
$user = new User;

// retrieve user's job
$user1 = $user->find(1);

if($user->has_result())
{
    echo 'User\'s name is : '.$user1->name;
    echo 'User with id '.$user1->id.' has '.count($user1->job).' jobs, with these details : ';
    foreach($user1->job as $job)
    {
        var_dump($job->to_array()); // since in 'job_user' table, user_id 1 have 2 job, this will give you a set/array of 'job' with id '1' and '2'

         // You can now, for example, update some job data
         if($job->name == 'Politician')
         {
            $job = 'This is a pseudo job.';
            var_dump($job->save()); // will update any record(s) in 'job' with 'job_user'.'user_id' = 1 and have 'Politician' as name argument
         }
    }

   
}

// otherwise, you can also retrieve user table from job table as well
$job = new Job;

// retrieve job
$job1 = $job->find(1);

if($job->has_result())
{
    echo 'Job\'s name is : '.$job1->name;
    echo 'Some users which work as '.$job1->name.', are : ';
    foreach($job1->user as $user)
    {
        var_dump($user->to_array()); // since in 'job_user' table, job_id 1 belongs to 2 users, this will give you a set/array of 'user' with id '1' and '2'

         // You can now, for example, update some user data
         if(strpbrk($user->email, 'world') == 'world.com')
         {
            $user->email = str_replace('world', 'geek', $user->email);
            var_dump($user->save()); // will update any record(s) in 'user' with 'job_user'.'job_id' = 1  and have 'world.com' phrase in their email argument
         }
    }
}
```

#### Eager Loading
Gas support eager loading, so you can improve your relationship queries. Eager loading works for all $realations properties that you defined. Based by examples above, you can eager loading any type of relationship tables, using **with()** method. 

In short, instead doing this :

```php
$user = new User;

// retrieve all users
$all_users = $user->all();

if($user->has_result())
{
    // ...
    foreach($all_users as $single_user)
    {
        foreach($single_user->job as $job) 
        {
            var_dump($job->to_array()); 
        }
    }
}
// heres you actually will doing SELECT as many as your user counts, this bad for your mother health
var_dump($user->last_query());
```

You can eager loading your relational table, which defined in $relations properties :

```php
$user = new User;

// retrieve all users
$all_users = $user->with('job')->all(); // make sure you put with() method before any other finder method

if($user->has_result())
{
    // ...
    foreach($all_users as $single_user)
    {
        foreach($single_user->job as $job) 
        {
            var_dump($job->to_array()); 
        }
    }
}
// now you just only doing two queries, one to SELECT all users, one to SELECT all jobs with WHERE IN clause.
var_dump($user->last_query());
```

You can eager load several models at a time too :

```php
$user = new User;

// retrieve all users
$all_users = $user->with('wife, 'kid', 'job')->all(); 

if($user->has_result())
{
    foreach($all_users as $single_user)
    {
        echo $single_user->name.' has these details :';

        echo $single_user->name.' has one wife :';
        var_dump($single_user->wife->to_array()); 

        echo $single_user->name.' has many kids :';
        foreach($single_user->kid as $kid) 
        {
            var_dump($kid->to_array()); 
        }

        echo $single_user->name.' has several jobs :';
        foreach($single_user->job as $job) 
        {
            var_dump($job->to_array()); 
        }

        echo '<hr />';
    }
}
// now you just only doing 4 queries, one to SELECT all users, three to SELECT all wife, kids and jobs with WHERE IN clause.
var_dump($user->last_query());
```
